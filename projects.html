    <!-- Add short project descriptions for school projects and classes. Work on personal projects to upload-->
    <p>
        At the current moment, most of my projects have come from school. This includes many group projects such as a
        calculator app made for android.
        I've also worked on various projects during my internship at United Wholesale Mortgage involving the cloud and
        the creation of bots to automate
        tasks done by the company. My current goal, besides this website, is to work on a simple game that I will upload
        any progress I make here. Currently,
        there are just ideas I have but I do plan on starting within the next few months.
